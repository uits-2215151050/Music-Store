        "Every beat reminds me of you, tearing me apart\nIn the million suns that shine, you're the brightest star\nAt the break of dawn, you're all I want, no matter how far\nOh darling, I try to move on",
        "Dancing through the night, under neon lights\nYour shadow follows me, holding me tight\nIn this concrete jungle, you're the only sight\nThat makes my broken heart feel right",
        "Whispers in the darkness, echoes of your name\nPlayin' with the fire, dancing in the flame\nNothing else matters, we're never quite the same\nBut I'd do it all again, never felt this pain",
        "Sunrise on the horizon, golden in your eyes\nEvery moment with you feels like paradise\nWhen the world falls down, you're my only prize\nReaching for forever, beneath the endless skies",
        "Melodies of yesterday, haunting all my days\nCaught up in the haze, lost within your gaze\nWalking through the memory, stuck within the maze\nSearching for a way out, setting hearts ablaze"
